Chart shows
* Sales fluctuation based on temperature
* Transactions fluctuation based on temperature
* Sales fluctuation based on precipitation
* Transactions fluctuation based on precipitation
* Weather type icons at bottom

Filter
* Date Range
* Layers: Actual Temperature, Average Temperature, Weather Icons
* Calendars: Events, Promotions Holidays

Display on both Overview and Weather pages.
Response to store category selection.

Temperature Calculation
# Get temperature effect from causal impact model for store.
# For each date, subtract actual temperature from average temperature over last 14 or maybe 30 days.
# Multiply temperature difference (above) by temperature effect to get temperature sales fluctuation.
# If daily weather included precipitation, add the precipitation effect from the causal impact model.
# If daily weather included snow, add the snow effect from the causal impact model.

Y-axis: Temperature
Series #1: Rolling average temperature
Series #2: Daily temperature
On hover, show weather impact calculation (Temperature effect + Precipitation effect + Snow effect = Total effect : this is the same value shown on profitability calculation)

These impact numbers come from the model of Axon BSTS.

*Questions*
# What are different weather icon types and how to interpret data to choose each one? Rain and Snow
# How to prevent ""icon overload"" by only showing ""relevant"" icons? [~edunne] will create stretched icon bands
# How should weather be displayed at higher levels than individual store? How to aggregate clusters? Average the temperature, choose majority weather icon, sum sales effects
# Filter layers are different on Overview and Weather pages. How to reconcile behavior? [~edunne] is simplifying the filters on the Overview
# Some models don't include weather at all. [~edunne] should we provide any special indication of this on the weather chart/page?

On the Red Lady workflow host during a run to update store observations, ""Context Switches/sec"" was over 20,000 on a 16-core box. This is high by every account.

Right now instances of ConcurrentTaskRunner are created:
* For each call to UpsertFromAsync (with different limits for Updates and Batch Writes)
* In the AggregateObservationGroupsStep.

Additionally, Task.Run is used:
* In ObservationRepository when creating seed observation groups.
* In SearchEnumerable when executing searches

Investigate each of these usages and implement a more intelligent design that limits the overall number of parallel tasks. Make this limit (or these limits) configurable, and choose smart configuration values for workflow (where multiple listeners are expected) and web (where few listeners are expected for now).",,gitlab,,,Implementation of changes.;28/Jul/16 1:42 PM;jbledsoe;4500,Implement changes.;08/Aug/16 4:49 PM;jbledsoe;18000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1800,22500,,,1800,22500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0|i009l3:,,,,,,,,,,Not started,,2016-08-08 16:45:19.592,"08/Aug/16 4:45 PM;gitlab;[John Bledsoe|https://www.nexosisdev.com/u/jbledsoe] mentioned this issue in [a commit of development/axon|https://www.nexosisdev.com/development/axon/commit/dc87f09adedd4b8be8515dacb6b630453988d7c3]:

* Create a UserControlller with an action named Image that accepts a GUID user ID, and returns the profile image for that user. (e.g. /User/Image/1cb6801e-f7a4-44bc-8ea2-89e8a1379eed.png) This should be the only way that profile images are retrieved in the application.

* Future iterations should have modal with a dropdown that drives the UI. For now, since it's just Shopify it can stay as is. 
* I added a ""Delete"" button and a modal to remove a store.

I worked around this issue by introducing a DTO for the service, which restores functionality, but the real solution is to use a different serializer/deserializer for ServiceStack. We are already using JSON.NET for workflow property serialization, and it handles dynamic objects properly. I propose we set the IStringSerializer used by ServiceStack to an implementation that uses JSON.NET.

This will let us bulk import events into Axon, as well as keep up events in Axon in sync with whichever calendars they maintain.

Some features / requirements that I can think of:
* A user needs to be able to give Axon access to read one of their calendars
* A user should be able to add a publicly visible Calendar to Axon as well (e.g. US Holidays)
* Before importing calendar entries into Axon, the user should be able to review what's about to be imported, so that the Event type, the assigned Category, etc. can be set properly
* The system should also make a first pass at assigning these attributes to the event.
* A similar approval / categorization system will need to be in place for events that are added to the calendar later on.


*Some notes after initial research*
* We can import iCal links from *private* links generated by the user.  However, that puts a burden on the user to manually go generate a private link, that we don't really want to do.
* Oauth is probably a pretty simple option. We've done it before, and could set something up to use Oauth and fetch a calendar pretty quickly.
* -Another option worth investigating (and I'm not sure if it's even possible) would be to have an application-specific calendar that a user could share with.  So, something like calendars+thechivery@nexosis.com.- -- doesn't look like this is really a viable option for now.  For one, short of generating a Google account for each user of our site it doesn't look like we could give them a way to share to calendars@nexosis.com with the '+' in the email.  Second, one of the perceived benefits of this approach is that we could then use Google calendar as the application calendaring feature in the app.  After thinking that option through some more, I realized that we wouldn't be able to embed that Google Calendar into the app without either making it public or authenticating to the Calendars@nexosis.com calendar from the front end.

2. When you select on of the 'last' options one day and come back the next, it's now off by one day as it does not stay current.

The solution is to expand the predictions range when a 'last' type range is selected, and to just show both observations and predictions of a specific date range when chosen.

* There are no timestamps on the notifications.  Should there be?
* If a user doesn't log in for several days, they're going to have a number of the same notification from several days (e.g 'Your data is updated', from each day).  Should they see this?  Or, should we only show them one of each 'Type' of notication (e.g. 'Predictions Completed', 'Data Updated', etc)
* Should 'Running' notifications be dismissable, or should we leave them up there and only let the user dismiss notifications that represent something being 'Completed'?","12/Oct/16 2:15 PM;edunne;[~cvermeer] - 

* I'm looking into adding timestamps
* Each notification should be specific to the action it is notifying for… impact for a specific LTO or promotion, adding a specific store, etc. What types of processes do we have that aren't tied to something unique and specific?
* Up in the description it says that ""processing/running"" notifications should disappear and be replaced with ""done"" notifications. ""Processing"" should be dismissable but will come back as a ""Done"" on completion.","13/Oct/16 1:07 PM;edunne;[~cvermeer] - Here is the new timestamp.

Our conceptual authorization scheme is still up in the air, and so that needs to be clarified as well. Are we using a user/role/right model, or are there other concepts (e.g. client, account) that are specific to our application and therefore should be baked into the authorization structure.

One option is to use a migrations library for DynamoDb:

https://github.com/arvindkumarc/dynamodb-migrate

This seems to be the only project on that I can find, even though it's just a thin wrapper around the DynamoDB API itself.  It has a single contributor, and zero stars however.  I must be missing something, because I'm not sure how else people are solving the issue of creating tables/indexes, etc. with Dynamo without something similar to migrations.

Combine this with http://jxcore.com/turn-node-applications-into-executables/ and you have a solution that can run at deployment time without requiring nodejs or anything installed.

Another option is to create the tables at runtime.  However, I'm leery of this because we currently only have one AWS account.  So, if a dev makes a change without running against their local DynamoDb they could easily create or alter the table in real DynamoDb and mess up the running app(s) in prod.  Running these through a migrations runner at least makes it more explicit.

This doesn't look like it's ready for use. I can't find any samples and the Source Code repo indicates they are just getting some basic things working.

This had UI workflow design elements for JavaScript on their roadmap. Perhaps some of it can be combined with one of the others.

It's a lightweight workflow manager based on Petri nets and taking some ideas from BPMN. NGinn BPM helps automate business processes in large organizations, such as telecoms, by enabling to build workflows that coordinate human work and flow of data between applications. The main goals of NGInn design are elasticity, simplicity and ease of integration.

It's a permanent work in progress project with some production deployments. Developed mainly in C# and using MS SQL as a database backend.

*Written to replace WF. It comes with a DSL written in boo for quick and easy configuration and management of state machine definitions.*

This means we can build and change the boo files to change the workflow without compilation.

","15/May/15 1:05 AM;j.monty;Business Process Model And Notation (BPMN) is a standard used to diagram workflows in a standard / portable way.
Spec: http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/

The BPMN 2.0 diagram modeling and rendering toolkit is a javascript based toolkit that generates these files.

This is a more robust solution with support for both relational and no sql DB's. Isn't free but isn't cost prohibitive.

Supports persistence and parallel tasks. Has a HTML workflow designer. 

Works with Mono.
*NOTE: *For Backend of WorkflowServer Mono need run with the flag FILE_CASE_SENSITIVE_SEARCH.

Available providers of databases:
• MS SQL Server / AsureSQL
• MongoDB
• RavenDB

If you are using a different database, you need to implement interfaces:
• IPersistenceProvider
• ISchemePersistenceProvider
• IRuntimePersistence
• IWorkflowGenerator","10/Sep/15 4:16 PM;jbledsoe;Workflow Engine .NET seems to be the truth. That designer is worth the price of admission.

EDIT: Now that we've dug a little bit deeper, I don't believe this is a good solution.

The prediction line starts very low where it overlaps observations, and then jumps to a more reasonable level after observations are done. This is due to a small number of stores with data ending sooner than the rest. Sooner end date leads to earlier prediction start date, and so when predictions are aggregated only a small number of stores are included.

To fix this issue visually, limit the start of any forecast line (not causal impact) to the last date of observations.

IStartEndDatesExtractor is also registered in Axon.Core, implemented by WeeklyStartEndDatesExtractor.

A class implementing IWorkflowBuilder is registered in RedLady.Workflow that accepts an IStartEndDatesExtractor to its constructor.  That WorkflowBuilder class is getting the Monthly instance, when we expect it to get a Weekly instance.

As a workaround we pass the container itself into the workflowbuilder, and call resolve inside its constructor., and we get the instance we expect.

The theory is that Windsor is 'binding' the dependency graph at registration time to the first instance it finds, but perhaps before the Weekly implementation is registered.",,cvermeer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0|i00b8n:,,,,,,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggregate Weather,AXON-921,20001,,Task,Accepted,AXON,Axon,software,rsevey,"Software development tasks for the core Axon engine and related development environments including public and internal web applications / interfaces and client specific functionality.

This is NOT for data science research, infrastructure, or anything non-development related. Get off my lawn.",,Medium,,cvermeer,cvermeer,cvermeer,11/Aug/16 2:06 PM,23/Aug/16 8:38 AM,01/Nov/16 4:03 PM,,,,,,,0,,,,"So that we can show weather graphs for things like entire states efficiently, we should aggregate weather data.

Thinking on implementation is as follows:
* Each item in a store category is assigned a level (the S2 Level from the S2 geometry library) for aggregation.
* All Stores get Level 9, which is roughly a square 25km wide
* Cities and states will be assigned levels lower than that.  Can vary by item (e.g. RI vs TX)

Once those are assigned, modify the weather import workflow so that it works as follows:
* Gather all Stores' lat/longs and aggregate by the store-level grouping, and get weather for all of those locations and store as observations.
* For each distinct level from all categories above Store, make a pass through the Weather data, aggregating that data by the S2 Cell's ID at that level.
* Store the aggregate weather data with a hash key matching the ID for the cell at the aggregate level.

Finally, when querying weather data for a higher-level category than store:
* Query for all stores underneath that category
* Collect their lat/longs, convert those S2 cells to points at the level matching the category being queried, then get the distinct cells
* Query all weather data for those cells, then aggregate / average.


This all still means that a query for e.g. Texas' weather will likely result in multiple queries to  the Observations table.  However, it should still mean far fewer than the current method, which queries weather for all of the stores underneath that category.

So, the logic for assigning a geographic level to a category will be to start at level 9 (which is the default level at which we're grouping store-level weather right now), then move down levels until we reach a geographic level at which all of the stores under that category fall into 5 or fewer blocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of the logic and structure for these two will be similar (formatting parameters for R packages, calling R, writing observations to file, etc.).  Significant portions will differ, though.  For example, results out of CausalImpact are significantly more complex than with Axon.Forecast (JSON formatted, include things like lift calculations, etc).

So, plan for adding support is as follows:

* 	Add algorithm and parameters
* 	Rename CompositeTimeSeriesForecastStep to something else.  Still thinking about the best name
* 	Create CausalImpactAlgorithmStep that plugs into CompositeTimeSeriesForecastStep
**		Copy relevant parts of RTimeSeriesForecast step into CausalImpactAlgorithm
** 		Get working
* 	Then refactor / remove duplication between CasualImpact
** 		Change TimeSeriesForecast to TimeSeriesAlgorithm (or the like) and consolidate
** 		Extract out common logic between TimeSeriesForecast and TimeSeriesAlgorithm
***			Things that are likely just in TimeSeriesForecast

'Merge remote-tracking branch 'gitlab/master' into AXON-761'","05/Jul/16 4:08 PM;jbledsoe;Code review feedback for [~ealmario]:
* RemoveProfileImage in UserStoreService returns a null string. Should just be a void method.
* contentTypes dictionary in UserStoreService should be static, since it's shared, and should be of type IReadOnlyDictionary<string,string>.
* IUserProfileManager<T> has a name that doesn't really reflect what it does. I would change the interface as follows:

{code:java}
public interface IDefaultUserProfileImageRetriever
{
    string RetrieveProfileImageUrl(IdentityUser user);
    Task<string> RetrieveProfileImageUrlAsync(IdentityUser user);
}
{code}

* The IDefaultUserProfileImageRetriever interface should be declared in Axon.Core, so that client projects don't need to reference Axon.Services to override it.
* The DefaultUserProfileImageRetriever should actually retrieve /Content/img/avatars/missing-avatar.jpg.
* There's no need to pass the LoginProvider and ProviderKey on the ExternalLoginConfirmationViewModel. Those values are already available within AccountController.ExtrenalLoginConfirmation. Move the logic which sets the profile image to after the call to UserManager.AddLoginAsync is checked for success, but befor ethe user is signed in.
* ManageController.EditProfile shouldn't attempt to sign the user in again I don't think. Let me know if there's a compelling reason that the method is doing so.
* ApplicationUserManager.GetProfileImage should accept a string userId as its argument rather than a service request.
* ApplicationUserManager.UpdateProfileImage should accept a string userId, a Stream imageStream, and a string contentType (e.g. image/jpeg). This method should handle all of the logic (currently duplicated in AccountController and ManageController) of writing the image file to S3 and updating the ProfileImageUrl property on the IdentityUser.
* GetProfileImage and UpdateProfileImage on ApplicationUserManager should have async equivalents, just like the other methods on UserManager. The synchronous variants should call the async variants.
* PepsiUserProfileManager should be renamed to GravitarUserProfileImageRetriever and should be moved into Axon.Web.Core alongside DefaultUserProfileManager. The logic that retrieves the NBC.png should be taken out and replaced with the missing-avatar.jpg

This task is to look into using that same concept for the rest of our projects, using the following model:

* build.cmd (or build.sh) in the root of the repository.  This is the primary entry point for builds.  Any build automation system (Jenkins, Gitlab CI, etc) will just invoke this file
* build.cmd may delegate to another build scripting tool (for Axon I'm currently thinking of looking into PSake, because 1.) Powershell is ubiquitous on Windows and 2.) We use Powershell a lot in our Jenkins builds, so can re-use those snippets), or it may not (as would probably be the case for builds on linux systems).

This task consists of many sub-tasks, but at it's completion we will ingest inventory information daily from NBC and use that inventory information in computing recommended order quantity. Whatever formula we end up on to compute recommended order quantity, we'll subtract out the projected inventory on that date.

Inventory information can be found in the following RoutEx tables:
* IITBAL2 – This is our main inventory balance table.  This contains the item balance quantities for various inventory transactions (Sales, Purchases, Transfers,etc.)
* PMPOSUM/PMPODET – This contains the outstanding purchase orders summary & product detail.
* ICOUNT2 – This is the physical count of each item with the count date.
* RINVHIST/RSALSDT2 – This is the Sales History invoice summary/product detail.

From these tables we should be able to compute ""current inventory"" as of the date predictions are being run. From there we can project what inventory will be on a future order date and use that value for computing the recommendation for the order date.

Subtasks (which need to be created) include
* Extract inventory data from NBC and upload to SFTP.
* Download inventory data from SFTP and ingest.
* Create function to compute projected inventory based on current inventory, projected demand forecast, past actual order quantities and future recommended order quantities.
* Include projected inventory in determination of recommended order quantity for a given day.
* Show projected inventory on public web somewhere.

It'd be great to have a mechanism by which these mappings could be specified once and used in all three scenarios. I believe that a fluent interface using .NET Expression classes is the ideal mechanism, because it allows for both compilation of expressions into functions to get and set property values (in either direction) and parsing of property names for mapping of errors.

I want to go back and update that dashboard to include that information but am struggling to figure out how to do it. I think it might be a lot like weather where a user would have an average sentiment score and any deviation up would be more money and below would be less. Does that work?","20/Sep/16 12:25 PM;edunne;*From [~rwest] email*

Matt and I are still trying to figure out how this would work, too.  It is similar to weather, although weather changes based on located whereas tweets (or other social media posts) can happen anywhere in the country.  So it's uncertain how tweets affect sales/transactions at individual stores, unless we are able to categorize tweets by location, too.","20/Sep/16 12:26 PM;edunne;*From [~msteinpreis] email*

The way this should probably be done is to include the sentiment score as an additional feature in the model. We would do this at the store level, since that’s the level of the modeling, but we could just use the national sentiment score; this means that every [company] store would have the same sentiment feature.
 
In order to do this, we would need a time series of the sentiment value. Once we have a time-series representation of the sentiment, then we could just throw it into the model, and then the representation of its effect would be similar to what we do for weather.
 
That being said, I’m not very confident that this is going to yield any noticeable results, except for in unique cases like the Chipotle listeria. But those cases might be interesting enough to pursue this.","20/Sep/16 12:26 PM;edunne;Okay. I have the sentiment over time in the current dashboard already. I think most cases are going to be at a national level since I don’t know that brands have sub accounts at the individual store level.

Once users are registered I think login is inconsequential, but the use cases around registration aren't clear to me.

It seems to me that establishment of a ""client/account"" is something that needs to happen on our end, and that not just anyone can register as a user for that ""client/account"". Nexosis would need to verify that at least the first registered user (the ""account owner"") is valid and associated with the client in real life. Nexosis could continue to verify additional users, or could delegate that job to the account owner. In any case there is a workflow involved that is different than a typical public web application, for which anyone can register.

There are infrastructure implications to registration as well. If we have multiple client-specific silo applications for Axon Forecasting (as [~emiller] has proposed), then this fact affects our registration scenarios.

To be clear, the notion that each customer stack might be sandboxed was borne out of the early discussions regarding the desire to be able to deliver the same solution to premise customers as we do in the cloud.  Jason and Ryan experienced some pushback during discovery with initial clients regarding BI data in the cloud, so the only way to mitigate this (for premise customers) is to deliver the solution, and all of its components, in a self-contained premise package.  Docker was mentioned as a potential deployment tool, and that makes sense to me.

At some point we switched gears from away from Docker towards a simplified MVP arch that we are working on now. I think this decision was made in the interest of time and agility, as Docker does indeed add an additional layer of abstraction that would indeed complicate the dev process for you guys and another competency that would require grokking out.

So, my suggestion to potentially sandbox the cloud version, customer by customer,  is really just to keep the faith with Jason's original idea of keeping the delivery model consistent as possible between cloud and premise.  Sandboxing each customer in their own env has the added benefit of you guys not having to mess with coding for multi tenancy, and gives us a layer of security that isolates customers from each other at the infrastructure level (just like they would be with a standalone Docker stack on a premise box).  As such, this sandboxed stack model lends itself to ""Dockerization"" for premise consumption and keep BI data where the customer's seem to want it.  From a security/performance standpoint, one customer is physically incapable of accessing another's data or negatively impacting the performance of the system as a whole, by putting unexpected high load on the system that impacts all customers instead of just themselves.  The resource costs should be roughly the same in either model (monolith or isolated stacks), since our utilization will be what it is.

That said, if things have changed regarding overall direction/strategy, this discussion was never really a proposal or suggestion as much as it was/is just Jason and I thinking out loud about delivery / deployment models and options.  I'm not sure this topic ever gained the official stamp of authoritative approval, though.

Hope this helps?



","21/Sep/15 12:32 PM;j.monty;In the interest of time, we don't need any registration right now. We can stage production for customers internally (put accounts in manually). We don't have any use cases yet for how this will work at scale so I don't see any reason to build it right now.

We will need to specifically outline how we onboard different customers and right now with NBC at least, it is not important. With SkuVault next - registration won't be a thing. We'll need to workout how to onboard skuvault customers but that also will be done behind the curtain - customers won't be directly enrolling there either. We should delay registration until a later stage.

Even if we define a registration process for a new customer, they won't be able to do anything reasonable in the system unless we have already done the work internally of setting them with their proper workflow (data import, ML process, data output, etc) so the idea of having a registration for users publicly is a waste of time at this stage. There is one scenario I can see wanting and that's related to use wanting to offload the administrative burden of adding additional users for NBC, for instance, to have access to their portal. The use case I could see having, is that we'd add the first account for them, and then they can internally add more user accounts through an 'administrative' section of the portal. Though for now, they could just use a shared account until we get further along so I feel there's no need for this at all right now seeing as only a few people from NBC will be needing access anyway.
